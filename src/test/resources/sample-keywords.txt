ID   3D-structure.
AC   KW-0002
DE   Protein, or part of a protein, whose three-dimensional structure has
DE   been resolved experimentally (for example by X-ray crystallography or
DE   NMR spectroscopy) and whose coordinates are available in the PDB
DE   database. Can also be used for theoretical models.
HI   Technical term: 3D-structure.
CA   Technical term.

ID   Complete proteome.
AC   KW-0181
DE   Protein which is part of a proteome. A proteome is the set of protein
DE   sequences that can be derived by translation of all protein coding
DE   genes of a completely sequenced genome, including alternative products
DE   such as splice variants for those species in which these may occur.
DE   Proteomes may include protein sequences from both the reviewed
DE   (UniProtKB /Swiss-Prot) and unreviewed (UniProtKB/TrEMBL) sections of
DE   the UniProt Knowledgebase. Note that some proportion of the predicted
DE   protein sequences of a given proteome may require further review or
DE   correction. The precise proportion depends on the relative
DE   distributions of protein sequences between the two sections of
DE   UniProtKB and the quality of the underlying genome sequence and gene
DE   predictions.
